# Implement a function csv2json(). The function receives a file_path of csv file and file_path of a new json file
# that will be created by a function. The function should read xÂ§the original csv file, convert the data in it
# into json, and store the contents of the csv file as a json file that contains a list of objects. For example,
# for this csv file the result should be like this json file
import csv
import json
